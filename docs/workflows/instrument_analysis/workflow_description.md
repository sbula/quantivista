# Instrument Analysis Workflow

## Overview
The Instrument Analysis Workflow is responsible for analyzing financial instruments using both technical and fundamental approaches. This workflow processes instrument metadata, calculates technical indicators, performs clustering analysis, and detects anomalies to provide a comprehensive understanding of financial instruments and their relationships.

## Workflow Sequence
1. **Instrument metadata collection and validation**
   - Gather basic instrument information (symbol, name, type)
   - Collect exchange and listing details
   - Validate instrument identifiers (ISIN, CUSIP, etc.)
   - Maintain instrument reference data

2. **Fundamental data integration**
   - Incorporate earnings data and financial ratios
   - Process balance sheet and income statement metrics
   - Include analyst ratings and price targets
   - Integrate ESG scores and sustainability metrics

3. **Corporate actions processing**
   - Handle stock splits and reverse splits
   - Process dividend announcements and payments
   - Manage mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs
   - Adjust historical data for corporate actions

4. **Clustering of instruments based on characteristics**
   - Group instruments by sector, industry, and geography
   - Cluster based on price movement correlations
   - Identify instruments with similar volatility profiles
   - Create dynamic clusters based on changing market conditions

5. **Computation of technical indicators**
   - Calculate moving averages (simple, exponential, weighted)
   - Compute momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic)
   - Determine volatility measures (Bollinger Bands, ATR)
   - Identify support and resistance levels

6. **Cross-instrument correlation analysis**
   - Calculate correlation matrices across instruments
   - Identify leading and lagging relationships
   - Detect correlation regime changes
   - Analyze sector and industry correlations

7. **Feature engineering for ML models**
   - Create derived features from raw data
   - Generate time-series features at multiple frequencies
   - Normalize and standardize features
   - Select relevant features for different model types

8. **Anomaly detection for unusual price movements**
   - Identify statistical outliers in price and volume
   - Detect pattern breakdowns and unusual formations
   - Monitor for abnormal correlation changes
   - Flag potential market manipulation patterns

9. **Distribution of analysis results**
   - Publish technical indicators to event streams
   - Distribute clustering results to subscribers
   - Provide correlation data to dependent services
   - Alert on detected anomalies and unusual patterns

## Usage
This workflow is used by:
- **ML Prediction Service**: Uses technical indicators and clustering information as input features
- **Trading Strategy Service**: Incorporates technical analysis into trading strategies
- **Risk Analysis Service**: Utilizes correlation data for risk calculations
- **Portfolio Optimization Service**: Leverages clustering for diversification strategies
- **Reporting Service**: Includes technical analysis in reports and dashboards

## Improvements
- **Separate technical indicator computation from clustering** for better scalability
- **Create reusable feature engineering components** for consistency across services
- **Implement real-time anomaly detection** for faster response to market changes
- **Add support for alternative data sources** (ESG scores, social sentiment)

## Key Microservices
The primary microservices in this workflow are:
1. **Technical Analysis Service**: Computes technical indicators and performs statistical analysis on market data with high performance and accuracy
2. **Instrument Clustering Service**: Groups financial instruments based on various characteristics and behaviors using advanced machine learning techniques

## Technology Stack
- **Rust + RustQuant + TA-Lib**: For high-performance technical indicator calculation
- **Python + scikit-learn + JAX**: For advanced clustering and machine learning
- **Apache Kafka**: For reliable data distribution
- **TimescaleDB**: For time-series data storage

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient calculation of technical indicators for thousands of instruments
- Real-time updates of indicators as new market data arrives
- Scalable clustering algorithms for large instrument universes
- Optimized correlation calculations for large matrices
