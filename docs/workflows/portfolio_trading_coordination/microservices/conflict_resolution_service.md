# Conflict Resolution Service

## Responsibility
Signal conflict detection and resolution when multiple signals compete for limited portfolio resources. Implements sophisticated prioritization algorithms and resource allocation optimization.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python + optimization libraries + decision theory
- **Libraries**: cvxpy, pulp, scipy.optimize, decision analysis libraries
- **Scaling**: Horizontal by conflict complexity
- **NFRs**: P99 resolution < 300ms, optimal conflict resolution

### Event Output
```pseudo
Event conflict_resolved {
    event_id: String
    timestamp: DateTime
    conflict_resolved: ConflictResolvedData
}

struct ConflictResolvedData {
    resolution_id: String

    allocation_efficiency: Float
}

// Example Event Data
{
    event_id: "uuid",
    timestamp: "2025-06-21T10:00:00.000Z",
    conflict_resolved: {
        resolution_id: "resolution_001",
        conflicts_resolved: 3,
        signals_prioritized: 5,
        resource_allocation: {
            total_available: 1.0,

            allocation_efficiency: 0.92
        },
        resolution_quality: 0.88
    }
}
```

## Implementation Estimation

### Priority: **MEDIUM** (Advanced coordination feature)
### Estimated Time: **3-4 weeks**

#### Week 1-2: Core Resolution Engine
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Basic prioritization and resource allocation
- Optimization framework setup
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 2 weeks = 4 dev-weeks

#### Week 3-4: Advanced Resolution & Integration
- Multi-objective optimization
- Advanced resolution strategies
- Integration with coordination engine
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 2 weeks = 4 dev-weeks

### Total Effort: **8 dev-weeks**
### Team Size: **2 developers**
### Dependencies: Trading signals, portfolio constraints

### Success Criteria:
- P99 resolution latency < 300ms
- Optimal resource allocation efficiency > 90%
- Conflict resolution quality > 85%
- Support for complex multi-signal conflicts
