# Portfolio Trading Coordination Workflow

The Portfolio Trading Coordination Workflow serves as the critical bridge between individual trading signals and coordinated portfolio-level execution. It integrates trading signals with portfolio constraints, applies risk policies, and generates coordinated trading decisions that optimize portfolio-level outcomes while respecting individual signal quality.
