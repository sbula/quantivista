# Smart Order Routing Service

## Responsibility
Intelligent order routing across multiple venues and dark pools. Optimizes venue selection based on liquidity, cost, speed, and market impact considerations. Provides dynamic routing decisions with real-time venue quality assessment.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: C++ + Python hybrid for ultra-low latency routing decisions
- **Libraries**: Custom routing engines, market data libraries, optimization frameworks
- **Data Processing**: Polars for high-performance data manipulation (5-10x faster than pandas)
- **Analytics**: DuckDB for complex analytical queries and aggregations
- **ML Framework**: JAX for custom optimization algorithms and advanced models
- **Scaling**: Horizontal by venue connections, ultra-low latency architecture
- **NFRs**: P99 routing decision < 5ms, optimal venue selection, real-time adaptation

- Basic venue selection algorithms
- Real-time venue quality assessment
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 2 weeks = 4 dev-weeks

#### Week 3-4: Advanced Routing Logic
- Machine learning-based venue selection
- Dynamic routing optimization
- Multi-venue order splitting
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 2 weeks = 4 dev-weeks

#### Week 5-7: Performance & Integration
- Ultra-low latency optimization
- Integration with venue connections
- Routing performance validation
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 3 weeks = 6 dev-weeks

### Total Effort: **14 dev-weeks**
### Team Size: **2 developers** (1 senior C++ developer, 1 quantitative developer)
### Dependencies: Venue connectivity, market data, execution monitoring

### Success Criteria:
- P99 routing decision < 5ms
- Optimal venue selection > 92% accuracy
- Real-time venue quality adaptation
