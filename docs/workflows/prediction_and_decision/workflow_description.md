# Prediction and Decision Workflow

## Overview
The Prediction and Decision Workflow is responsible for generating price predictions and making trading decisions based on market data, technical analysis, and market intelligence. This workflow combines machine learning models, risk assessment, and strategy optimization to produce actionable trading signals with appropriate position sizing and timing.

## Workflow Sequence
1. **Feature collection and aggregation from upstream services**
   - Gather market data features (price, volume, volatility)
   - Collect technical indicators (moving averages, momentum, etc.)
   - Incorporate news sentiment and impact assessments
   - Aggregate instrument clustering information
   - Combine alternative data signals

2. **Model selection based on market conditions and instrument characteristics**
   - Evaluate current market regime (trending, mean-reverting, volatile)
   - Consider instrument-specific characteristics
   - Select appropriate prediction models
   - Adjust model parameters based on market conditions
   - Implement ensemble model selection

3. **Price prediction for multiple timeframes**
   - Generate directional predictions (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Produce price target estimates
   - Create predictions for various time horizons (short, medium, long-term)
   - Update predictions in real-time as new data arrives
   - Track prediction accuracy and adjust accordingly

4. **Confidence interval calculation for predictions**
   - Estimate prediction uncertainty
   - Calculate probability distributions for price movements
   - Determine confidence levels for different scenarios
   - Adjust intervals based on market volatility
   - Incorporate model uncertainty metrics

5. **Risk metrics computation for instruments and clusters**
   - Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR
   - Compute volatility forecasts
   - Assess correlation risks
   - Evaluate liquidity risks
   - Determine maximum drawdown estimates

6. **Strategy parameter optimization**
   - Tune entry and exit thresholds
   - Optimize stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Adjust risk-reward parameters
   - Calibrate timeframe-specific settings
   - Perform walk-forward optimization

7. **Trade decision generation with reasoning**
   - Produce actionable signals (buy/sell/hold/close)
   - Include decision confidence scores
   - Provide detailed reasoning for each decision
   - Generate alternative scenarios
   - Prioritize signals based on expected return

8. **Position sizing calculation based on risk/opportunity ratio**
   - Determine optimal position sizes
   - Apply risk-based sizing rules
   - Consider portfolio-level constraints
   - Adjust for instrument volatility
   - Implement Kelly criterion or variations

9. **Order timing optimization**
   - Identify optimal execution windows
   - Analyze market microstructure
   - Recommend execution strategies
   - Estimate market impact
   - Optimize for transaction costs

10. **Distribution of trading signals with metadata**
    - Publish signals to downstream services
    - Include comprehensive metadata
    - Provide execution recommendations
    - Distribute risk assessments
    - Supply monitoring parameters

## Usage
This workflow is used by:
- **Order Management Service**: Receives trade decisions for execution
- **Portfolio Management Service**: Uses signals for portfolio adjustments
- **Reporting Service**: Includes prediction and decision data in reports
- **Risk Management Service**: Monitors decision impact on overall risk
- **Notification Service**: Alerts users about significant trading signals

## Common Components
- **Risk calculation components** used in multiple workflows
- **Decision logic** may share common algorithms
- **Model evaluation metrics** are standardized
- **Feature preprocessing** pipelines are reused

## Improvements
- **Create a dedicated risk calculation service** for centralized risk assessment
- **Separate prediction from decision making** for better specialization
- **Implement ensemble modeling** for improved prediction accuracy
- **Add explainable AI features** for decision transparency

## Key Microservices
The primary microservices in this workflow are:
1. **ML Prediction Service**: Generates price movement predictions using ensemble machine learning models with uncertainty quantification
2. **Risk Analysis Service**: Calculates comprehensive risk metrics for instruments, portfolios, and strategies with real-time monitoring
3. **Trading Strategy Service**: Implements trading strategies and generates trade decisions with comprehensive backtesting and optimization capabilities

## Technology Stack
- **Python + JAX + Flax + Optuna + MLflow**: For advanced machine learning and prediction
- **Rust + RustQuant + nalgebra**: For high-performance risk calculations
- **Rust + Backtrader + PyPortfolioOpt**: For strategy implementation and optimization
- **Apache Kafka**: For reliable data distribution

## Performance Considerations
- Real-time prediction updates as new data arrives
- Efficient risk calculation for large portfolios
- Scalable model serving architecture
- Low-latency decision generation
- Parallel processing of multiple instruments and strategies
