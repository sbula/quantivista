# Platform-Configuration-and-Strategy Workflow

## Overview

The Platform-Configuration-and-Strategy Workflow is responsible for defining, validating, optimizing, deploying, and monitoring trading strategies within the QuantiVista platform. It provides a structured approach to strategy lifecycle management, ensuring that strategies are properly tested, approved, and monitored in production.

## Workflow Sequence

1. **Strategy Definition and Validation**
   - Creation of strategy specifications with clear parameters and constraints
   - Validation of strategy logic and parameter boundaries
   - Documentation of strategy objectives, risk parameters, and expected behavior

2. **Parameter Optimization and Backtesting**
   - Historical backtesting against market data
   - Parameter optimization using machine learning techniques
   - Performance evaluation across different market conditions
   - Stress testing under extreme market scenarios

3. **Risk Constraint Definition**
   - Setting maximum position sizes and exposure limits
   - Defining drawdown thresholds and stop-loss rules
   - Establishing correlation and concentration limits
   - Creating compliance rules and regulatory constraints

4. **Deployment Approval Workflow**
   - Peer review of strategy performance and risk metrics
   - Compliance and risk management approval
   - Gradual deployment with increasing capital allocation
   - A/B testing against existing strategies

5. **Live Strategy Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance tracking against expectations
   - Drift detection from expected behavior
   - Risk limit monitoring and alerting
   - Execution quality assessment

6. **Performance Evaluation and Adjustments**
   - Regular performance reviews and attribution analysis
   - Parameter adjustment recommendations
   - Market regime change detection
   - Strategy improvement iterations

7. **Strategy Lifecycle Management**
   - Version control of strategy definitions
   - Deprecation planning for underperforming strategies
   - Capacity management and scaling decisions
   - Documentation of strategy evolution

8. **Version Control and Rollback Capabilities**
   - Immutable history of strategy changes
   - Emergency rollback procedures
   - Audit trail of all modifications
   - Comparison tools for strategy versions

## Key Components

### Configuration Service
The Configuration Service manages the platform-wide configuration settings, environment-specific parameters, and feature flags. It provides centralized configuration management with versioning and rollback capabilities.

### Strategy Management Service
The Strategy Management Service handles the definition, validation, deployment, and lifecycle management of trading strategies. It provides tools for strategy development, backtesting, optimization, and monitoring.

## Integration Points

### Upstream Services
- **User Service**: Provides authentication and authorization for strategy management
- **Market Data Service**: Supplies historical data for backtesting and optimization
- **Technical Analysis Service**: Provides indicators and patterns for strategy development

### Downstream Services
- **Trading Strategy Service**: Receives deployed strategy definitions for execution
- **Risk Analysis Service**: Receives risk constraints and monitors compliance
- **Portfolio Optimization Service**: Uses strategy parameters for portfolio allocation
- **Reporting Service**: Receives strategy performance data for reporting

## Data Flow

1. Strategy developers create or modify strategy definitions through the Strategy Management Service
2. The service validates the strategy logic and parameters
3. Backtesting is performed using historical data from the Market Data Service
4. Optimization algorithms suggest optimal parameter values
5. Risk constraints are defined and validated
6. The approval workflow collects necessary sign-offs
7. Approved strategies are deployed to the Trading Strategy Service
8. Live monitoring tracks performance and risk metrics
9. Performance evaluations trigger adjustments or lifecycle decisions
10. All changes are version-controlled with rollback capabilities

## Technology Stack

- **Java + Spring Boot**: Core services implementation
- **Git**: Version control for strategy definitions
- **Docker**: Container-based deployment for isolation
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for configurations and strategies
- **Redis**: Caching for frequently accessed configurations
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming for configuration changes
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for deployment and scaling

## Performance Considerations

- Fast access to configuration values with minimal latency
- Efficient backtesting of strategies against large historical datasets
- Real-time monitoring of multiple concurrent strategies
- Rapid deployment and rollback capabilities
- Scalable parameter optimization for complex strategies

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control for strategy management
- Approval workflows for production deployments
- Audit logging of all configuration changes
- Secure storage of sensitive configuration values
- Segregation of duties between strategy development and approval

## Compliance Requirements

- Complete audit trail of strategy changes
- Documentation of strategy logic and parameters
- Evidence of backtesting and risk assessment
- Approval records for all production deployments
- Regular performance reviews and attestations

## Disaster Recovery

- Automatic backup of all configuration and strategy definitions
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Emergency rollback procedures
- Configuration versioning and comparison tools
- Redundant storage across multiple availability zones

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Configuration change notifications
- Strategy performance deviation alerts
- Risk limit breach notifications
- Deployment and rollback event logging
- Health checks for configuration and strategy services

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based strategy suggestion engine
- Automated strategy optimization based on market conditions
- Natural language processing for strategy documentation
- Visual strategy builder with drag-and-drop components
- Collaborative strategy development with team workflows
