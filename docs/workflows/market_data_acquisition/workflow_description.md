# Market Data Acquisition and Processing Workflow

## Overview
The Market Data Acquisition and Processing Workflow is responsible for collecting, validating, normalizing, and distributing market data from various sources. This workflow ensures that high-quality, standardized market data is available to all downstream services in the QuantiVista platform.

## Workflow Sequence
1. **Tick data ingestion** from brokers and data providers
   - Connect to various data sources (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, IEX Cloud, Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, etc.)
   - Collect real-time and historical market data
   - Handle connection failures and retries

2. **Data validation and quality checks**
   - Verify data completeness and accuracy
   - Detect anomalies and outliers
   - Apply data quality metrics and thresholds
   - Flag suspicious or erroneous data

3. **Data normalization and standardization**
   - Convert data to a common format
   - Standardize timestamps and time zones
   - Normalize instrument identifiers
   - Apply consistent naming conventions

4. **Real-time data enrichment**
   - Process corporate actions (splits, dividends)
   - Add metadata and context
   - Enrich with additional market information
   - Cross-reference with reference data

5. **Storage of raw and processed market data**
   - Persist raw data for audit and replay
   - Store processed data for analysis
   - Implement efficient time-series storage
   - Apply appropriate retention policies

6. **Distribution to downstream services via event streams**
   - Publish data to event streams
   - Implement topic-based subscriptions
   - Ensure reliable delivery
   - Provide data access APIs

## Usage
This workflow is used by:
- **Technical Analysis Service**: Consumes normalized market data to calculate technical indicators
- **ML Prediction Service**: Uses market data as input features for prediction models
- **Risk Analysis Service**: Analyzes market data for risk calculations
- **Trading Strategy Service**: Makes trading decisions based on market data
- **Reporting Service**: Generates reports and visualizations using historical market data

## Common Components
- **Data validation and normalization** is needed across multiple workflows
- **Storage patterns** are similar for different data types
- **Quality metrics tracking** is shared across data sources

## Improvements
- **Separate raw data ingestion from processing** to allow independent scaling
- **Create dedicated services for different data types** (market data, news, alternative data)
- **Implement data lineage tracking** for audit and debugging
- **Add circuit breakers** for unreliable data sources

## Key Microservices
The primary microservice in this workflow is the **Market Data Service**, which is responsible for collecting, normalizing, and distributing market data with high reliability and low latency.

## Technology Stack
- **Rust + Tokio**: For high-performance, asynchronous data processing
- **Polars**: For efficient data transformation
- **Apache Kafka**: For reliable data distribution
- **TimescaleDB**: For time-series market data storage

## Performance Considerations
- High throughput data processing
- Low latency for real-time data
- Efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data
- Horizontal scaling for different data sources
