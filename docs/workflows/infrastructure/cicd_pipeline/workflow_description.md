# CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

## Overview
The CI/CD Pipeline Workflow is responsible for automated software delivery across the entire QuantiVista platform, ensuring reliable, secure, and efficient deployment of all microservices and infrastructure components. This workflow handles code integration, automated testing, security scanning, deployment orchestration, and environment management across development, staging, and production environments.

## Key Challenges Addressed
- **Multi-Service Deployment Coordination**: Orchestrating deployments across 50+ microservices with complex dependencies
- **Financial System Security**: Implementing comprehensive security scanning and compliance validation
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Ensuring continuous trading operations during deployments
- **Environment Consistency**: Maintaining identical configurations across dev, staging, and production
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Fast and reliable rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- **Compliance and Audit**: Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance requirements

## Core Responsibilities
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated code integration, testing, and quality validation
- **Security and Compliance**: Comprehensive security scanning and regulatory compliance checks
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Coordinated deployment across multiple environments and services
- **Environment Management**: Automated provisioning and management of development environments
- **Release Management**: Version control, release planning, and deployment coordination
- **Monitoring Integration**: Deployment health monitoring and automated rollback triggers

## NOT This Workflow's Responsibilities
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Cloud resource provisioning (belongs to Infrastructure as Code Workflow)
- **Application Monitoring**: Runtime monitoring and alerting (belongs to System Monitoring Workflow)
- **Business Logic**: Trading algorithms and strategies (belongs to respective workflows)
- **Data Management**: Database schema management (belongs to respective workflows)

## Pipeline Architecture

### Multi-Environment Strategy
```
Feature Branch → Development → Staging → Production
     ↓              ↓           ↓          ↓
   Unit Tests   Integration   E2E Tests  Blue/Green
   Security     Tests         Security   Deployment
   Scanning     Performance   Validation
                Testing
```

### Service Deployment Dependencies
```
Infrastructure Services (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL)
           ↓
Core Platform Services (Auth, Config, Monitoring)
           ↓
Data Services (Market Data, Intelligence, Analysis)
           ↓
Trading Services (Prediction, Decision, Coordination)
           ↓
Execution Services (Trade Execution, Portfolio Management)
           ↓
User Services (Reporting, UI)
```

## Workflow Sequence

### 1. Continuous Integration Pipeline
**Responsibility**: CI Service

#### GitHub Actions CI Configuration
```yaml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  code-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Code Quality Checks
        run: |
          make lint
          make format-check
          make complexity-check
          make dependency-scan

  unit-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [market-data, trading-decision, portfolio-management, trade-execution]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: |
          cd services/${{ matrix.service }}
          make test-unit
          make coverage-report

  security-scanning:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: SAST Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      - name: Container Security Scanning
        run: make security-scan-containers
      - name: Secrets Scanning
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main

  build-and-push:
    needs: [code-quality, unit-tests, security-scanning]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [market-data, trading-decision, portfolio-management, trade-execution]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build Container Image
        run: |
          cd services/${{ matrix.service }}
          docker build -t quantivista/${{ matrix.service }}:${{ github.sha }} .
      - name: Push to Registry
        run: |
          docker push quantivista/${{ matrix.service }}:${{ github.sha }}
```
