# Overall Project Plan - Automated Trading System
## Architecture Review and Recommendations
Based on microservices architecture patterns for financial trading systems [[1]](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) and analysis of high-performance trading architectures [[2]](https://github.com/ebi2kh/Real-Time-Financial-Analysis-Trading-System), the current workflow structure follows sound design principles. However, some considerations:
### ‚úÖ **Well-Designed Service Boundaries**
- **Market Data Acquisition**: Properly isolated data ingestion concerns
- **Instrument Analysis**: Clear separation between technical analysis and clustering
- **Trade Execution**: Isolated execution logic for performance optimization
- **Portfolio Management**: Appropriate separation of risk and optimization concerns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Boundary Issues to Monitor**
- **Reporting vs Analytics**: May have overlapping responsibilities - monitor for data duplication
- **Configuration vs Strategy**: Could potentially merge if strategy configuration becomes too coupled
- **System Monitoring**: Ensure it doesn't become a "god service" handling too many concerns
