## Integration Patterns

### Event Flow Architecture
```
Market Data → Intelligence → Analysis → Prediction → Trading Decision
                                                           ↓
Portfolio Management ← Trade Execution ← Portfolio Coordination
                ↓                              ↓
        Reporting & Analytics ← ← ← ← ← Trade Performance Analytics
                ↓                              ↓ (ML Training Data)
        User Interface ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Market Prediction (ML Feedback)
```

**Key Distinctions**:
- **Trade Performance Analytics**: Raw trading data → ML training datasets, execution optimization
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Aggregated data → Business reports, regulatory compliance, dashboards

### Infrastructure Support
```
Infrastructure as Code → CI/CD Pipeline → System Monitoring
                              ↓                ↓
                    Application Deployment → Health Monitoring
```
