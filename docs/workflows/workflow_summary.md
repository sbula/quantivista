## Integration Patterns

### Event Flow Architecture
```
Market Data → Intelligence → Analysis → Prediction → Trading Decision
                                                           ↓
Portfolio Management ← Trade Execution ← Portfolio Coordination
                ↓                              ↓
        Reporting & Analytics ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
                ↓
        User Interface
```

### Infrastructure Support
```
Infrastructure as Code → CI/CD Pipeline → System Monitoring
                              ↓                ↓
                    Application Deployment → Health Monitoring
```

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All workflows communicate via events
2. **Microservices Decomposition**: Each workflow contains 6-9 specialized services
3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: No overlapping responsibilities between workflows
4. **Technology Optimization**: Language choice optimized for each workflow's requirements
5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling designed into each service
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting across all layers

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Missing Workflows**: Portfolio Trading Coordination, Cash Management, Compliance
2. **Complete User Interface Workflow**: Finish mobile implementation and task-oriented design
3. **Resolve Overlapping Responsibilities**: Move portfolio awareness from Trading Decision to Portfolio Trading Coordination
4. **Enhance Integration**: Ensure all event contracts are properly defined and implemented
5. **Add Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Implement centralized logging, security, and configuration management
