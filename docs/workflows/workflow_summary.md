## Integration Patterns

### Event Flow Architecture
```
Data-Market-Acquisition → Data-Market-Intelligence → Data-Instrument-Analysis → Prediction-Market → Prediction-Trading-Decision
                                                                                                              ↓
Portfolio-Management ← Portfolio-Trade-Execution ← Portfolio-Trading-Coordination
                ↓                              ↓
        Analytics-Reporting ← ← ← ← ← Analytics-Trade-Performance
                ↓                              ↓ (ML Training Data)
        Platform-User-Interface ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Prediction-Market (ML Feedback)
```

**Key Distinctions**:
- **Analytics-Trade-Performance**: Raw trading data → ML training datasets, execution optimization
- **Analytics-Reporting**: Aggregated data → Business reports, regulatory compliance, dashboards

### Infrastructure Support
```
Infrastructure-as-Code → Infrastructure-CICD-Pipeline → Platform-System-Monitoring
                              ↓                                    ↓
                    Application Deployment → Health Monitoring
                              ↓                                    ↓
                    Platform-Configuration-and-Strategy → Platform-User-Interface
```

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All workflows communicate via events
2. **Microservices Decomposition**: Each workflow contains 6-9 specialized services

4. **Technology Optimization**: Language choice optimized for each workflow's requirements
5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling designed into each service
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting across all layers

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Missing Workflows**: Portfolio Trading Coordination, Cash Management, Compliance
2. **Complete User Interface Workflow**: Finish mobile implementation and task-oriented design
3. **Resolve Overlapping Responsibilities**: Move portfolio awareness from Trading Decision to Portfolio Trading Coordination
4. **Enhance Integration**: Ensure all event contracts are properly defined and implemented
5. **Add Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Implement centralized logging, security, and configuration management
