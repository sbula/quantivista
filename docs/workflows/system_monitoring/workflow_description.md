# System Monitoring and Alerting Workflow

## Workflow Description

The System Monitoring and Alerting Workflow is responsible for comprehensive monitoring of the entire QuantiVista platform, ensuring high availability, performance, and reliability. This workflow collects metrics, logs, and health data from all services, detects anomalies, generates alerts, and facilitates incident management and resolution.

## Workflow Sequence

1. **Metrics Collection**: Continuous collection of performance metrics, resource utilization, and business KPIs from all services and infrastructure components.
   
2. **Health Check Aggregation**: Regular polling of service health endpoints to determine overall system health and availability.
   
3. **Performance Threshold Monitoring**: Evaluation of collected metrics against predefined thresholds to identify potential issues before they impact users.
   
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Application of statistical and machine learning techniques to detect unusual patterns in system behavior that may indicate problems.
   
5. **Alert Generation and Escalation**: Creation of appropriate alerts based on severity and impact, with intelligent routing to the right teams.
   
6. **Incident Management and Tracking**: Systematic tracking of incidents from detection to resolution, including status updates and communication.
   
7. **Recovery Action Automation**: Execution of predefined recovery procedures for known issues to minimize downtime.
   
8. **Post-incident Analysis and Improvement**: Detailed analysis of incidents to prevent recurrence and improve system resilience.

## Workflow Usage

### Operational Monitoring

The workflow provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of all system components through:

- **Dashboards**: Customizable dashboards showing key metrics, service status, and alerts
- **Service Health Maps**: Visual representation of service dependencies and health status
- **Performance Trends**: Historical views of system performance metrics for capacity planning

### Alerting and Notification

The workflow delivers timely notifications about system issues through multiple channels:

- **Priority-based Alerts**: Different notification channels based on alert severity
- **On-call Rotation**: Automated routing of alerts to the current on-call team
- **Alert Aggregation**: Intelligent grouping of related alerts to prevent alert fatigue
- **Acknowledgment Tracking**: Monitoring of alert acknowledgment and response times

### Incident Management

The workflow facilitates efficient handling of incidents:

- **Incident Coordination**: Centralized view of ongoing incidents and their status
- **Runbook Integration**: Quick access to relevant runbooks and recovery procedures
- **Communication Templates**: Standardized formats for incident updates
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear procedures for escalating unresolved incidents

### Continuous Improvement

The workflow supports ongoing system reliability improvements:

- **Post-mortem Analysis**: Structured approach to analyzing incident causes and responses
- **SLO/SLA Tracking**: Monitoring of service level objectives and agreements
- **Reliability Metrics**: Tracking of key reliability indicators (MTTR, MTBF, error budgets)
- **Chaos Engineering**: Controlled failure testing to improve system resilience

## Integration Points

### Upstream Integrations

- **All Microservices**: Health check endpoints, metrics exporters, and log outputs
- **Infrastructure Components**: Kubernetes, databases, message queues, and networking
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deployment events and build metrics

### Downstream Integrations

- **Notification Service**: For delivering alerts to various channels
- **Documentation System**: For accessing runbooks and recovery procedures
- **Incident Management Tools**: For tracking and coordinating incident response
- **Reporting Service**: For generating reliability reports and dashboards

## Technology Stack

- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: For visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: For alert routing and management
- **Loki**: For log aggregation and querying
- **Jaeger**: For distributed tracing
- **OpenTelemetry**: For standardized instrumentation
- **PagerDuty**: For on-call management and escalation
- **Kubernetes Events**: For platform-level monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability

- Hierarchical collection architecture for large-scale deployments
- Metric aggregation and downsampling for long-term storage
- Distributed tracing sampling for high-volume services

### Security

- Encrypted communication for all monitoring traffic
- Role-based access control for monitoring dashboards
- Audit logging for all alert acknowledgments and silencing

### Reliability

- Redundant monitoring infrastructure across availability zones
- Monitoring of the monitoring system itself
- Fallback notification paths for critical alerts

### Performance Impact

- Low-overhead instrumentation libraries
- Configurable collection intervals based on metric importance
- Batched metric submission to reduce network overhead
