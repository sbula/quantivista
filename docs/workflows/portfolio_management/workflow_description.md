# Portfolio Management Workflow

## Overview
The Portfolio Management Workflow is responsible for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing investment portfolios across multiple strategies and asset classes. This workflow handles real-time position tracking, risk assessment, performance attribution, and portfolio optimization to ensure optimal risk-adjusted returns while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and investment mandates.

## Workflow Sequence
1. **Real-time position tracking and reconciliation**
   - Maintain accurate position records across all instruments
   - Reconcile positions with broker statements
   - Track cash balances and margin requirements
   - Monitor corporate actions impact on positions

2. **Portfolio-wide risk metrics calculation**
   - Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR
   - Compute portfolio beta and volatility
   - Assess exposure across sectors, geographies, and asset classes
   - Monitor concentration risk and diversification metrics

3. **Performance attribution analysis**
   - Calculate returns at portfolio, strategy, and position levels
   - Attribute performance to asset allocation and security selection
   - Compare performance against benchmarks
   - Analyze risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, etc.)

4. **Risk exposure optimization across strategies**
   - Identify overlapping exposures between strategies
   - Optimize aggregate risk exposure
   - Balance risk budgets across strategies
   - Manage correlation between strategy returns

5. **Rebalancing recommendations**
   - Generate portfolio rebalancing suggestions
   - Calculate optimal trade sizes for rebalancing
   - Minimize transaction costs and market impact
   - Maintain target allocations within tolerance bands

6. **Stress testing and scenario analysis**
   - Simulate portfolio performance under extreme market conditions
   - Model impact of interest rate changes, volatility spikes, etc.
   - Assess liquidity risk under stressed conditions
   - Evaluate potential losses in tail risk scenarios

7. **Compliance monitoring**
   - Enforce position limits and concentration constraints
   - Monitor regulatory requirements (e.g., margin, leverage)
   - Track investment mandate adherence
   - Generate compliance alerts and reports

8. **Performance benchmarking**
   - Compare performance against relevant indices
   - Calculate tracking error and information ratio
   - Perform peer group analysis
   - Evaluate strategy consistency and persistence

9. **Tax optimization strategies**
   - Identify tax-loss harvesting opportunities
   - Manage holding periods for tax efficiency
   - Optimize dividend and interest income
   - Track tax lots and cost basis information

10. **Reporting and visualization generation**
    - Create portfolio performance dashboards
    - Generate risk exposure reports
    - Produce compliance documentation
    - Develop custom client reporting

## Usage
This workflow is used by:
- **Trading Strategy Service**: Receives portfolio constraints and risk budgets
- **Risk Analysis Service**: Provides portfolio-level risk metrics
- **Order Management Service**: Receives rebalancing recommendations
- **Reporting Service**: Uses portfolio data for comprehensive reporting
- **User Service**: Delivers portfolio information to end users

## Improvements
- **Create a dedicated reporting service** for better separation of concerns
- **Implement a strategy definition service** for more flexible strategy management
- **Add multi-currency portfolio support** for global investment capabilities
- **Implement regulatory reporting automation** for compliance efficiency

## Key Microservices
The primary microservices in this workflow are:
1. **Portfolio Management Service**: Tracks positions, calculates performance, and manages portfolio data
2. **Portfolio Optimization Service**: Optimizes portfolio allocation and risk exposure using modern portfolio theory

## Technology Stack
- **Java + Spring Boot**: For robust enterprise capabilities
- **Python + PyPortfolioOpt + cvxpy**: For portfolio optimization algorithms
- **PostgreSQL**: For transactional data storage
- **Apache Kafka**: For event-driven architecture
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed portfolio data

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient calculation of portfolio metrics for large portfolios
- Real-time position updates and risk calculations
- Optimized rebalancing algorithms for large portfolios
- Scalable stress testing for multiple scenarios
