# Incident Management Service

## Responsibility
Comprehensive incident lifecycle management with automated response, escalation workflows, post-mortem generation, and integration with external incident management platforms. Provides incident tracking, resolution coordination, and learning from incidents.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java + Spring Boot + workflow engine + integration APIs
- **Libraries**: Spring Boot, Camunda (workflow), integration SDKs (PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow)
- **Data Processing**: Polars for high-performance data manipulation (5-10x faster than pandas)
- **Analytics**: DuckDB for complex analytical queries and aggregations
- **ML Framework**: JAX for custom optimization algorithms and advanced models
- **Scaling**: Horizontal by incident volume and workflow complexity
- **NFRs**: P99 incident creation < 1s, 99.9% workflow reliability, automated response < 30s

    Request: EscalationRequest
    Response: EscalationResult
```

### Event Output
```pseudo
Event incident_created {
    event_id: String
    timestamp: DateTime
    incident_created: IncidentCreatedData
}

struct IncidentCreatedData {
    incident_id: String
    title: String
    severity: String
    status: String
    affected_services: List<String>
    assigned_team: String
    automated_responses: List<AutomatedResponseData>
}

struct AutomatedResponseData {
    action_type: String
    execution_status: String
}

// Example Event Data
{
    event_id: "uuid",
    timestamp: "2025-06-21T10:00:00.000Z",
    incident_created: {
        incident_id: "INC-20250621-001",
        title: "Portfolio Management Service High Latency",
        severity: "SEV2_HIGH",
        status: "OPEN",
        affected_services: ["portfolio_management_service"],
        assigned_team: "platform-team",
        automated_responses: [
            {
                action_type: "scale_up_service",
                execution_status: "in_progress"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Database Schema

### PostgreSQL (Command Side)
```pseudo
Table incidents {
    id: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)
    incident_id: String (required, unique, max_length: 100)
    title: String (required, max_length: 500)
    severity: String (required, max_length: 20)
    status: String (required, max_length: 20)
    affected_services: JSON
    assigned_team: String (max_length: 100)
    created_at: Timestamp (default: now)
    resolved_at: Timestamp
}

Table automated_responses {
    id: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)
    response_id: String (required, unique, max_length: 100)
    incident_id: String (required, max_length: 100)
    action_type: String (required, max_length: 100)
    execution_status: String (required, max_length: 20)
    executed_at: Timestamp (default: now)
}
```

## Implementation Estimation

### Priority: **HIGH** (Critical for incident response)
### Estimated Time: **6-7 weeks**

#### Week 1-2: Core Incident Management
- Java service with Spring Boot
- Basic incident lifecycle management
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 2 weeks = 4 dev-weeks

#### Week 3-7: Advanced Features & Integration
- Automated response workflows
- Integration with external systems
- Performance optimization
- **Effort**: 2 developers × 5 weeks = 10 dev-weeks

### Total Effort: **14 dev-weeks**
### Team Size: **2 developers** (1 senior Java developer, 1 DevOps specialist)
### Dependencies: Alerting service, external incident management platforms

### Success Criteria:
- P99 incident creation < 1 second
- 99.9% workflow reliability
- Automated response < 30 seconds
- Complete incident lifecycle tracking
